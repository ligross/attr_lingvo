#### Rest Api

The Api is served using a Flask blueprint at `/api/` using Flask RestPlus class-based
resource routing.

#### Client Application

A Flask view is used to serve the `index.html` as an entry point into the Vue app at the endpoint `/`.

The template uses vue-cli 3 and assumes Vue Cli & Webpack will manage front-end resources and assets, so it does overwrite template delimiter.

The Vue instance is preconfigured with Filters, Vue-Router, Vuex; each of these can easilly removed if they are not desired.

## Installation

##### Before you start

Before getting started, you should have the following installed and running:

	$ pipenv shell
	```

## Development Server

Run Flask Api development server:

```
$ python run.py
```

From another tab in the same directory, start the webpack dev server:

```
$ yarn serve
```

The Vuejs application will be served from `localhost:8080` and the Flask Api
and static files will be served from `localhost:5000`.

The dual dev-server setup allows you to take advantage of
webpack's development server with hot module replacement.

Proxy config in `vue.config.js` is used to route the requests
back to Flask's Api on port 5000.

If you would rather run a single dev server, you can run Flask's
development server only on `:5000`, but you have to build build the Vue app first
and the page will not reload on changes.

```
$ yarn build
$ python run.py
```
